          <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
       
          <p>We invite industry practitioners, rule system providers,
          technical experts and developers, rule users, and
          researchers who are using rule-based systems, developing
          systems and applications, or exploring problems and best
          practices (especially in the areas of system
          interoperability, rule interchange, or business agility), to
          share their ideas, results, and experiences. We invite
          submissions related (but not limited to) to one or more of
