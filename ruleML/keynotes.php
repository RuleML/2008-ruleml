          <h4 style="clear: left;">Abstract</h4>

          <p>The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) is a W3C activity aimed
          at developing a Web standard for exchanging rules. The need
          for rule-based information processing on the Semantic Web
          has been felt ever since RDF was introduced in the late
          90's. As ontology development picked up pace this decade and
          the limitations of OWL became more apparent, rules were
          firmly put back on the agenda.  RIF is therefore a major
          opportunity for the introduction of rule based technologies
          into the main stream of knowledge representation and
          information processing.</p>

          <p>Despite its humble name, RIF is not just a format and is
          not primarily about syntax. It is an extensible framework
          for rule-based languages, called RIF dialects, which
          includes precise and formal specification of the syntax,
          semantics, and XML serialization of the dialects. In this
          talk we will discuss the main principles behind RIF,
          introduce the RIF extensibility framework, and present the
          Basic Logic Dialect---the only fully developed RIF dialect
          so far. We will also discuss the opportunities for community
          involvement in furthering this standard.</p>

          <p>This talk is about the rise of Complex Event Processing
          (CEP) as we know it today, its historical roots and its
          current position in commercial markets. Some possible
          long-term future roles of CEP in the Information Society
          will be discussed along with the need to develop rule-based
          event hierarchies on a commercial basis to make those
          applications possible. The talk will try to make the point
          that "Rules are everywhere" and that mathematical formalisms

          <h4 style="clear: left;">Abstract</h4>

          <p>The convergence of business rules with business  process management (BPM) has been predicted for many years and is now a matter  of fact. Every major BPM vendor has incorporated or acquired rules technology  within their products and platforms. However, most rules offerings are only  loosely integrated with processes at the task level. The use of business rules  remains largely confined to managing isolated decisions services. Weak  integration and isolation effectively relegates rules to an implementing role  rather than a first class citizen in the capture and management of enterprise  knowledge. </p>
          <p>As the largest vendors bring their rules  offerings to market and as standards from the W3C and OMG mature to adequacy,  the opportunity for vendor-agnostic business rules management systems (BRMS)  approaches. And continued improvement in end-user accessibility of BRMS  promises ever less technical and ever more semantic expression and management  of enterprise knowledge, including process and service models in addition to  data models and business rules. </p>
          <p>The ability to interchange more semantic  models across major vendor offerings promises to dramatically increase the  market demand for reusable, enterprise-relevant knowledge. But as knowledge  becomes increasingly declarative and independent of implementations, it naturally  becomes more ontological. Unfortunately, current ontological technologies are  functionally inadequate from a business process or event processing  perspective. These inadequacies include the lack of ontology for events,  processes, states, actions, and other concepts that relate to change over time.  Without such ontologies, rules or logic that govern processes or react to  events must remain at the level of procedural implementation rather than  declarative knowledge. </p>
          <p>Until BRMS understand rules that refer to  activities and events occurring within business processes, business rules applications  will remain largely confined to discrete decisions, such as encapsulation  within a decision service. By incorporating an adequate ontology of events and  action, however, the knowledge management capabilities first developed in BRMS  will broaden to encompass much of BPM and complex event processing (CEP). Given  the fact that BRMS has been incorporated by the dominant platform vendors,  modeling should move up from the relatively narrow perspective of a BRMS into  the broader context of BPM and CEP. </p>
          <p>The migration of business rules management  into event and process contexts will emphasize the separation of business rules  into ontology versus behavior. Modeling event-driven and business processes  will correspond to defining ontology. Implementing event-driven and business  processes will invoke behaviors at runtime. The ontology will be the same for  BPM, CEP, or the BRMS, as will the behaviors. But the BRMS will know what is  happening in terms of events and processes and it will know what processes it can  invoke and what events it can signal. </p>
          <p>As ontology management becomes increasingly  relevant across application development, the limitations of related standards  will also come into clearer focus. Commercial BRE are, for the most part,  production rule systems that emphasize action over logic. This is best  addressed by OMG's production rule representation (PRR) standard. But PRR is an  isolated standard that includes no support for ontology or logic. W3C's  web-ontology language (OWL) and rule interchange format (RIF) standards address  ontology and logic, but not change or action. The same is true of OMG's SBVR,  which emphasizes linguistics, in addition to ontology and logic, albeit in a  way that remains disconnected with the OMG stack, including PRR. </p>
          <p>Bridging events, processes and other  aspects of reality that occur and change over time and incorporating action is  a fundamental challenge for semantic technologies, especially formal logic,  that must be addressed in a practical manner before rules standards and  semantic technologies will bear substantial fruit in enterprise contexts.</p>

          <h4 style="clear: left;">Abstract</h4>

          <p>We overview the approach taken by the SILK system, a new, highly ambitious effort to redefine the knowledge representation (KR) playing field for business rules and rule-based process management. The newest part of Vulcan Inc.'s Project Halo, SILK aims to provide key infrastructure for widely-authored VLKBs (Very Large Knowledge Bases) for business and science that answer questions, proactively supply information, and reason powerfully. SILK includes a highly expressive, fully semantic, rule language based expressively on the Hyper Logic Programs KR, together with components for reasoning, web knowledge interchange, and collaborative knowledge acquisition. </p>
          <p>Hyper LP newly synergizes several major strands of pure-research progress in KR based on extensions of declarative logic programs, which are the core KR of RuleML and Rule Interchange Format (RIF) as well as of databases (SQL, XQuery, and SPARQL) and most commercial implementations of OWL ontologies. Hyper LP adds: prioritized defaults cf. courteous and Defeasible Logic; higher-order and frames cf. F-Logic; tight integration of weakened full classical logic (including OWL) cf. generalized Description LP; actions and events cf. production rules, Event-Condition-Action rules, and Situated/Production LP. </p>
          <p>Key challenges for SILK include exploiting natural language in user interaction, parallelism in reasoning, and disjunction in expressiveness. We discuss prospects for the SILK approach to effectively interchange and integrate a high percentage of the world's structured knowledge starting from today's legacy forms. &quot;SILK&quot; stands for &quot;Semantic Inferencing on Large Knowledge&quot;, what the next generation Web will be spun from. </p>
