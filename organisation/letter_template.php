    <p>Dear [name],</p>

    <p>We would like to inform you about the International RuleML
    Symposium on Rule Interchange and Applications (RuleML-2008, <a
    href="http://2008.ruleml.org/">http://2008.ruleml.org/</a>), which
    we organize, co-located with the Business Rules Forum, in Orlando,
    Florida, USA, October 30-31, 2008. </p>

    <p>RuleML-2008 is the primary industrial-oriented event of the Web
    and Business Logic community which joins the practically oriented
    Forum of the Business Rules community (<a
    href="http://www.businessrulesforum.com/">http://www.businessrulesforum.com</a>)
    to help cross-fertilizing between Web and Business Logic
    technology. After last yearâ€™s highly successful RuleML-2007 (<a
    href="http://2007.ruleml.org/">http://2007.ruleml.org</a>),
    RuleML-2008 provides an excellent opportunity for your
    organization to be associated with an innovation driven technology
    market, characterized by strong market growth, visibility and
    commercial opportunities.</p> <p>Would you be willing to arrange
    for sponsoring the RuleML-2008 event by your organization? </p>
    <p>In recognition of your support, RuleML-2008 will acknowledge
    your organization's sponsorship in the ways explained below and in
    the attached sponsoring package.</p> <p>Please also let us know if
    you have any further suggestions regarding this first-of-its-kind
    event.</p>
